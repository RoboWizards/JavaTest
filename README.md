###Commits
*Use the title for a specific reason! 


Issue Tracker
========
* ToDo issues should be left to lead developer.
* Follow format when creating issues! It takes a few extra seconds & keeps everything much clearer to understand
* Remember to close issues! This helps me keep track of who is doing what & what needs to be done, fixed etc.

###ToDo issue

Issues for keeping track of what needs to be done. ToDo issues should use the "ToDo" tag, and the "Priority" tag if applicable. ToDo issues will also be assigned to a developer by the lead programmer. The following format should be followed in creating a ToDo issue:

**Title**: A word or two specifically saying what this is (Ex: Pneumatic System)
```
Proposed Addition-
What is it that needs to be done? What components are involved?

Suggested usage-
Should this be controlled by a joystick combo? Is this N/A due to it being a non-controlled system?
```

###Enhancement issue

Issues for features already implemented that require more attention or new additions / deletions. Enhancement issues should use the "Enhancement" tag & priority tag if applicable. Enhancement issues are last priority, and any developer may work on it when they have the time. Enhancement issues should follow this format: 

**Title**: A word or two specifically saying what this applys to & what you wish to do (Ex: Re-bind Joystick Controls)
```
Current Usage-
What does it currently do?

Suggested usage-
What do you wish it to do?

Why should we change i?t-
Explain why this needs to be enhanced.
```

###Bug issue

Issues for bugs in our code. Anytime a bug is encountered an issue should be made. This allows us to create a large resource center for future debugging. Any programmer or member can make a bug & is encouraged to do so when they find one. Bug issues should have the "Bug" tag, but should not use the "Priority" tag due to all bugs being a priority. If a developer chooses to fix a bug they should close the issue with how they solved it. When creating a bug follow this format:

**Title**: A word or two specifically describing the bug (Ex: Robot drives inverse directions)
```
What should it be doing?-
Ex: The robot should be driving fowards when I move the joystick foward.

Current usage-
Ex: The robot drives backwards when I push foward.

Any additional info you have related?-
Ex: Build number, happended after [X] commit, etc)
```
